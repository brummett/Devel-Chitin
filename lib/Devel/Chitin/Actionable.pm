=head1 NAME

Devel::Chitin::Actionable - Get and set breakpoints and actions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $unconditional_bp = Devel::Chitin::Breakpoint->new(
                            file => $filename, line => 123 );

  my $conditional_bp = Devel::Chitin::Breakpoint->new(
                            file => $filename, $line => 123,
                            code => q($a eq 'stop'));

  my $inactive_bp = Devel::Chitin::Breakpoint->new(
                            file => $filename, $line 123,
                            inactive => 1);

  my @bp = Devel::Chitin::Breakpoint->get(file => $filename, line => 123);
  printf("breakpoint on line %d of %s: %s\n",
            $bp[0]->line, $b[0]->file, $bp[0]->code);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Used to manipulate breakpoints and actions in the debugged program.
Breakpoints are used to stop execution of the debugged program and let the
debugging system take control there.  Actions are used to run arbitrary
code before a line in the debugged program executes.

=head1 Breakpoints

Breakpoints are associated with a file and line number, and the same
file/line combination may have more than one breakpoint.  Before executing a
line with one or more breakpoints, all those breakpoints with string C<code>
attributes are tested by eval-ing, as a string eval, their C<code> in the
context of the debugged program; these can be used to implement a conditional
breakpoint that stops depending on some condition in the program code.
Coderef C<code> attributes are called directly, and get no special scoping.

If any of these tests returns true, the debugger will stop the
program before executing that line.

=head2 Constructor

  my $bp = Devel::Chitin::Breakpoint->new(file => $f, line => $l,
                                        [ code => $code ],
                                        [ once => 1 ],
                                        [ inactive => 1]);

Creates a new Breakpoint object.  C<file> and C<line> are required arguments.
C<file> must be a filename as it appears in $main::{"<_$file"}.  If C<code>
is omitted, the value "1" is used as a default which creates an unconditional
breakpoint.  If C<once> is a true value, then the breakpoint will delete
itself after triggering.  If C<inactive> is true, the breakpoint will not
trigger.

The breakpoint code can be either a string or a coderef.  Strings are executed
as a string-eval, and are evaluated in the context of the program being
debugged.  Coderefs are called directly, and behave according to normal
scoping rules.

=head2 Methods

=over 4

=item my @bp = Devel::Chitin::Breakpoint->get(file => $f, %other_params);

Retrieve breakpoints.  Always returns a list of matching breakpoints.
C<file> is required, and if no other filters are used, returns all the
breakpoints for that file.  You may also filter by line, code and inactive.

=item $bp->file

=item $bp->line

=item $bp->once

Read-only accessors that return whatever values were used to create the
breakpoint.

=item $bp->code

=item $bp->code($string)

Mutator that retrieves the breakpoint's code condition, or sets it.

=item $bp->inactive();

=item $bp->inactive( 1 | 0);

Mutator that retrieves the current inactive flag, or sets it.

=item $bp->delete();

Remove a breakpoint.  Deleted breakpoints will never trigger again.

=back

=head1 Actions

Actions are a lot like breakpoints; they are associated with a file and line
number, and they have code that runs before that line in the program is
executed.  The difference is that the return value from the code is ignored.

The code is evaluated in the context of the running program if specified as
a string, so it can, for example, affect variables there or print them out.
Coderefs are called directly, and get no special scoping.

=head2 Constructor

  my $act = Devel::Chitin::Action->new(file => $f, line => $l, code => $code,
                                        [ once => 1],
                                        [ inactive => 1]);

Creates a new Action object.  C<file>, C<line> and C<code> are required
arguments.  C<file> must be a filename as it appears in $main::{"<_$file"}.
breakpoint.  If C<once> is a true value, then the action will delete
itself after running.  If C<inactive> is true, the action will not run.

=head2 Methods

=over 4

=item my @acts = Devel::Chitin::Action->get(file => $f, %other_params);

Retrieve actions.  Always returns a list of matching actions.  C<file> is
required, and if no other filters are used, returns all the actions for
that file.  You may also filter by line, code and inactive.

=item $act->file

=item $act->line

=item $act->once

Read-only accessors that return whatever values were used to create the
action.

=item $act->code

=item $act->code($string);

Mutator that retrieves the action's code, or set it.

=item $act->inactive();

=item $act->inactive( 1 | 0);

Mutator that retrieves the current inactive flag, or sets it.

=item $act->delete();

Remove an action.  Deleted actions will never run again.
