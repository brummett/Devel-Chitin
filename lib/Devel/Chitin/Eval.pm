=head1 NAME

Devel::Chitin::Eval - Implementation for Devel::Chitin::eval()

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is responsible for evaluating a string in the context of the
debugged program.  One idiosyncrasy in the process is that this eval is
done in the context of the closest stack frame not in package DB.  That's
why Devel::Chitin::eval() works as it does, requiring a debugger subclass
to cede control back and delivering the result via a callback.

If you can arrange for your debugger code to be in package DB, and for all
the stack frames up to the debugged program to be in package DB, then you
can call DB::_eval_in_program_context directly without the callback, and
get the result back directly.
